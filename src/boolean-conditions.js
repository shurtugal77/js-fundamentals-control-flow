// Initialise the didPass variable with a boolean value
let didPass

// 1. Create a conditional statement that changes the answer variable to the string
// "Well done, you passed!" if didPass is true, or "Sorry, try again!" if didPass
// is false
let answer

// 2. When you're done and the test passes, changing didPass to the opposite boolean
// and run the test again to make sure it still passes

// Don't change the code below this line
